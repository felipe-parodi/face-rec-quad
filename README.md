# Face-rec-quad
Real-time face detection and recognition for macaque monkeys.

Scripts:
- `train_yolo_face_det.py`: Train a YOLO model for face detection.
- `yolo_realtime_inference.py`: Real-time face detection.

Data: See [gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-hRzIeAdXGI_QNBKDt966Kx2Uz7G8xJN?usp=sharing) for sample images.

Next steps:
- Collect larger dataset for training.
- Label monkey IDs.
- Finetune detection (YOLO) and recognition (ArcFace).
